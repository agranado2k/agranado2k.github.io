London, Feb 17th, 2019.

Hello! If you don't know me, my name is Arthur. I'm from Brazil and lived my last 16 years in Rio de Janerio, where I studied computer science in UFF (Universidade Federal Fluminense) and my masters in computer engineering in UFRJ (Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro).

I worked in many companies there (I promise that I'll write more about it in the future). Also I founded two companies there, [Smartcoin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/smartcoin-payments/about/), that is closed now. And [Pluga](https://pluga.co/en) that I heped to co-found in November 2015, and I worked there as CTO until July 2017. Finally I moved to London in Febrary 2018, where I started working in some companies. You can know more in my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agranado2k/).

When I moved to here it was not easy for my, because the language and culture (the weather too) are different for me, special for someone who lived in Rio de Janeiro! :) One of the reasons to create this web site is to help me improve my English. So if you find any errors in my content, let me know in the comments that I'll be happy to correct it!

I hope that in my journey to improve my English I can write some articles that are interesting for you. I'm really interesting to write articles about software development,  my life in London and short sci-fi stories.

Fet your seat belts and enjoy it!

See you soon.

Arthur Granado
